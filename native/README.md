# The Rounders Native

This directory is the controlled product shell replacing Streamlit as the primary user experience. The legacy Python analytics remain available while functionality moves behind explicit APIs.

## Principles

- Mobile-first product UI
- Provider adapters instead of sportsbook-specific UI code
- Every datum is labeled live, model, or simulated
- Paper mode is the safe default
- No provider secret is exposed to the browser
- Streamlit can remain an internal analytics/admin surface during migration

## Local run

1. cd native
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

The starter market endpoint intentionally returns simulated data until a live provider adapter is configured.
